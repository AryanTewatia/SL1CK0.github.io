        <div>ikr the website look cool and all , kinda looks professional and clean , good to go but we all know down the line this is not the end for Slicko to stop creating masterpices instead it is a beginning for projects that are more functional, beautiful, complex and useful. At the current state of Slicko mind in this text here, vents out feelings and Idea for upcoming project. 
        </div><br>
        <div>Telling about the next project it's something related to secrets and something to cope with emba..... oh shit i think i've told yeh enough :/ hope to keep the rest of this idea a big secret till its up. You know what, while think-typing imma just assure yeh that the upcoming site will be a dynamic one :) . atleast will try my best to do so.+ imma update that works link soon whenever i complete my next big project.(you know and flex these things for resume buildup and shit).
        btw if you want to ask anything about this website i would be more than excited to explain you each and every stuff(not js though cause i am still stuck learning that).
        </div><br>
        <div>damn you reading all this stuff, thank you! and to make it better I am open to feedbacks, opinions and ideas of your own. it would be great if you drop your feedback about this site or got some ideas to share for future works or if not anything, just be down for some chit-chat ;) yeh know where to find me. 
            
        </div><br>
        <div>Thank you again for your support and for continuing to honor and celebrate the life of Slicko.</div><br>
